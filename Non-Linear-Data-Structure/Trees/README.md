# Non Linear Data Structure

in Non Linear Data Structue the data in not stored in lineary but it orginied in hirarchy..
Or 
- A Tree is Defined as a finite set of one or more nodes such that 
-- Thare is a spacial node that is #Root None (R)
-- The Remaining Nodes are Devided into N > 0 dissjoint state T1, T2, TN..., Where each of this states are tree
-- T1, T2, .. TN its call #SubTree OF the Root (R)
-- 


Note :
LeafNode - a node wivh havn't any child node is called leaf node



- Tree
- Graph
is the most imp data Structue

#Tree
How to Structture And Traverse
Create
Delete
And Other Operation

- The Travese
1 InOrder
2 PreOrder
3 Post Order

# The_Graph
- a Grap is a set of Node and Edges 
- in a graph ther is no Spacial Node(Unique Node) as Root Node
- v


# Tree lac-2 Types of Tree

- General Tree:
it is a tree where each node my have 0 or more sub-nodes


- Forest: (Groups Of Trees)
a forest is a set of n>0 disjoint trees
or the collection to 


- Binary Tree:
a tree is called binary tree if its each and every nodes has 0,1 or 2 Child Node

- Strict Binary Node: 
if tree called strict binary tree if each and every node hase 0 or 2 branches/outdegree/childerens

- Complate Binary Tree:
a binary tree is called a complate binary tree, if all lavel accept last lavel have a maximum number of possible childerens


- Lavel Number:
a lavel is a number of parent node corresponding to a given node of he tree.
it is basicly a number of ensure from that node until the root node

a node wich have 0 in degre its a root node
a node which have 0 out degree its a leaf node


- Path:
a siquance of connecting edges from one node to another node its called path

the number of lavels or the maxumum lanth from root node to last node its nothing but a dephth of the tree

# The Orders
ther are 3 types of order

- InOrder
- PreOrder
- PostOrder

- In Order Traversal Algorithms and steps

1 Check if trees != empty
    if(tr != null){
        trv(lptr[t])
    }else{
        exit()
    }
2 Traverse left node
3 Traverse root node
4 Traverse eight node
